# Cash Register Workshop Completed



Basic application of JavaFX and simple usage of conditionals and loops to calculate and display graphically the prices of items and sales tax, receive appropriate payment, and give change in the correct denomination of notes.

Even though this is supposed to be the "completed" version of Cash Register, just like anything else, there is *always* room for improvement. How can you build upon this foundation to make something even greater? Make sure to check out the links below if you want to look into the specific topics this may entail.



### 1. How to deal with improper user input
  a. Users may enter wrong type of data or no data at all. The easy way for a program to deal with this is to just crash, getting the user   really frustrated. It’s the programmer’s job to make sure that this doesn’t happen to the user and tell the user that they have done       specifically blah blah blah wrong.


### 2. Ability for user to customize what is included with the program. For example, it would be nice if the user had control over:
a. Tax rates

b. Giving categories to different types of items (Object-Oriented Programming: goo.gl/zUmXDa)

c. Being able to add and rename items in the inventory, creating the new items when needed while the program is being run, rather than in Scene Builder (Creating Buttons dynamically: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/javafx/button.html)

d. Possibly even store this data in a text file (Reading and writing to text files: http://www.codejava.net/java-se/file-io/how-to-read-and-write-text-file-in-java)


### 3. Making it look more consistent
a. Format all number values that are displayed to look like dollar values even if the number ends in a 0 (13.0 ->13,00) (Using different decimal formats http://www.tutorialspoint.com/listtutorial/Example-of-Formatting-number-in-Java-with-DecimalFormat/3881)
